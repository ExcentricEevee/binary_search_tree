# Binary Search Tree

This is a project from [The Odin Project][1]'s Ruby on Rails/Computer Science section, for the sake of practicing different data structures and algorithms. This implementation creates a balanced binary search tree which requires a sorted array as input and utilizes a queue structure to build the tree. After a tree is built, it will accept a list of different method calls in order to add or remove from the tree, or to utilize its data in some way such as Breadth-first and Depth-first searches.

The Odin Project's specifications for this project can be [found here][2].
